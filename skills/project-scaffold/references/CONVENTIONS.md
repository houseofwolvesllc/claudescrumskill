# Project Management Conventions

This document defines the shared standards used across all project management skills.
All PM skills reference this file — update it here and changes propagate everywhere.

## GitHub Project Structure

### Project Board Custom Fields

Every GitHub Project board MUST include these custom fields:

| Field | Type | Values | Purpose |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| Status | Single select | `Backlog`, `Ready`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Done` | Kanban workflow state |
| Sprint | Iteration | 2-week cycles (configurable) | Sprint assignment |
| Priority | Single select | `P0-Critical`, `P1-High`, `P2-Medium`, `P3-Low` | Triage priority |
| Executor | Single select | `claude`, `human`, `cowork` | Who works this story |
| Story Points | Number | 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 | Fibonacci estimation |
| Phase | Single select | Derived from PRD phases | Maps back to PRD structure |

### Project Board Views

Create these views on every project board:

1. **Current Sprint** — Board layout, filtered to `Sprint = @current`, columns by Status
2. **Claude Queue** — Table layout, filtered to `Executor = claude` AND `Status = Ready`, sorted by Priority
3. **My Tasks** — Table layout, filtered to `Executor = human`, grouped by Sprint
4. **By Sprint** — Board layout, grouped by Sprint (creates swimlanes per sprint)
5. **Phase Overview** — Table layout, grouped by Phase, with field sums on Story Points
6. **Backlog** — Table layout, filtered to `Status = Backlog`, sorted by Priority

## Label Taxonomy

### Executor Labels (REQUIRED on every story)

- `executor:claude` — Claude Code handles implementation autonomously
- `executor:human` — Requires human judgment, decision-making, or external action
- `executor:cowork` — Lighter tasks suitable for Cowork/Chrome agent (research, drafts, web tasks)

### Status Signal Labels

- `ready-for-work` — Fully specced, unblocked, ready to pick up
- `needs-context` — Missing information; cannot begin until resolved
- `blocked` — Dependent on another issue (MUST link blocking issue)
- `deferred` — Intentionally pushed to a future sprint
- `rolled-over` — Incomplete from previous sprint, gets priority in next planning

### Type Labels

- `type:story` — A user-facing feature or capability
- `type:bug` — Defect in existing functionality
- `type:spike` — Research/exploration task with defined timebox
- `type:infra` — Infrastructure, CI/CD, tooling, DevOps
- `type:chore` — Maintenance, cleanup, refactoring, documentation

### Priority Labels

- `P0-critical` — Blocking release, security issue, or data loss risk
- `P1-high` — Core functionality for the current phase
- `P2-medium` — Important but not blocking
- `P3-low` — Nice-to-have, polish, optimization

## Branch Strategy

### Branch Naming

- **Release branches:** `release/<milestone-slug>` (e.g., `release/phase-1-core-api`)
- **Story branches:** `story/<issue-number>-<short-slug>` (e.g., `story/42-user-auth-endpoint`)
- **Spike branches:** `spike/<issue-number>-<short-slug>`
- **Bug fix branches:** `fix/<issue-number>-<short-slug>`

### Merge Strategy

```
main (protected)
 └── release/phase-1-core-api (sprint release branch)
      ├── story/1-init-project-structure
      ├── story/2-database-schema
      ├── story/3-auth-endpoints
      └── story/4-user-crud
```

- **Story → Release branch:** Auto-merge when CI passes. No human review required.
- **Release → main:** Human review required. This is the executive approval gate.
- Story PRs target the release branch, NOT main.
- Release PR to main includes a sprint summary (auto-generated by sprint-release skill).

### Branch Protection Rules

For the release branch:
- Require status checks to pass (CI/tests)
- Allow auto-merge when checks pass
- No required reviewers

For main:
- Require status checks to pass
- Require at least 1 reviewer (the human executive)
- No force pushes
- No deletions

## Issue Template

Use this template for every story/task issue:

```markdown
## Objective
[What this accomplishes — one clear sentence]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion]

## Technical Context
[Architecture notes, relevant files, API contracts, approach guidance.
For executor:claude — be specific about code paths, patterns, and test expectations.
For executor:human — explain why this needs human judgment and what decisions are needed.]

## Dependencies
- **Blocked by:** [#issue or "none"]
- **Blocks:** [#issue or "none"]
```

## Milestone Structure

- Each PRD **phase** becomes a GitHub **milestone**
- Milestone title format: `Phase N: <Phase Name>` (e.g., `Phase 1: Core API`)
- Milestone description: Copy the phase summary from the PRD
- Milestone due date: Derived from sprint cadence and story point estimates
- Stories are assigned to milestones based on their phase

## Sprint Cadence

- Default sprint length: **2 weeks** (configurable per project)
- Sprint naming: `Sprint <N>` within the project's iteration field
- A phase may span multiple sprints if the work exceeds one cycle
- At sprint boundaries, incomplete stories roll to the next sprint with a `rolled-over` label

## Story Point Guidelines

| Points | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Trivial — config change, copy update | Update an env variable |
| 2 | Small — single file, clear implementation | Add a validation rule |
| 3 | Medium — multiple files, straightforward | New API endpoint with tests |
| 5 | Large — cross-cutting, some unknowns | Auth system with middleware |
| 8 | Very large — significant complexity | Database migration with data transform |
| 13 | Epic-sized — should probably be split | Full feature module end-to-end |

If a story estimates at 13, consider splitting it into smaller stories.

## Executor Assignment Guidelines

### Assign `executor:claude` when:
- Implementation path is clear from acceptance criteria
- Work is primarily code: new features, endpoints, tests, refactoring
- No external approvals, account access, or human judgment needed
- Dependencies are resolved (status is `ready-for-work`)

### Assign `executor:human` when:
- Requires external service signup, credentials, or account configuration
- Involves business decisions, UX judgment calls, or stakeholder input
- Needs access to systems Claude cannot reach (vendor portals, billing, etc.)
- Requires physical-world action (hardware, meetings, approvals)

### Assign `executor:cowork` when:
- Research tasks: competitive analysis, documentation review
- Content drafting: blog posts, documentation, emails
- Web-based tasks: form submissions, data gathering from websites
- File organization and cleanup tasks
