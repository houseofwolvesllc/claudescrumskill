## [1.7.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added
- Two-pass scaffolding mode in `project-scaffold` — when triggered, splits PRD parsing across one skeleton-extraction agent (Pass 1) and one elaboration subagent per epic (Pass 2, max 3 concurrent). Keeps per-epic context tight on large PRDs so the last epic's stories are as well-specified as the first. Triggers in precedence order: CLI flag → PRD frontmatter (`scaffold_mode`) → word-count threshold (`scaffold.two_pass_threshold_words`, default 5000). Auto-downgrades to single-pass elaboration when Pass 1 yields ≤ 2 epics; degrades gracefully on Pass 1 / Pass 2 failure.
- Design-spike epic auto-injection in `project-scaffold` — prepends a research-driven pre-epic at position 0 when triggered. Stories produce one foundational ADR + one CONTEXT.md per implementation epic. Implementation epics are gated via the existing `blocked_by` mechanism; sprint planning naturally waits for the design-spike epic to complete before selecting implementation stories.
- CONTEXT.md template at `skills/shared/templates/CONTEXT-template.md` with seven required sections (Overview, Naming Conventions, File Layout, Shared Types & Interfaces, Patterns to Follow, Patterns to Avoid, External References).
- ADR template at `skills/shared/templates/ADR-template.md` following the Michael Nygard format.
- Config keys: `scaffold.two_pass_threshold_words` (default 5000), `scaffold.design_spike_enabled` (default true), `paths.context` (default `.claude-scrum-skill/context`).
- PRD frontmatter controls: `scaffold_mode: single-pass | two-pass`, `design_spike: true | false`. CLI flag equivalents (`--mode`, `--design-spike` / `--no-design-spike`) documented.
- Verification fixtures at `docs/specs/_fixtures/` (small PRD, large PRD, README with 9-case verification matrix from the source spec's Testing Strategy).
- `type:design-spike` label and `epic_type: design-spike` frontmatter field for canonical design-spike epic detection across all four backends (local, GitHub, Jira, Trello).
- ADR-0001 documenting the architectural decisions behind two-pass scaffolding and the design-spike epic.

### Changed
- `project-orchestrate` Step 3 subagent prompt instructs subagents to read the epic's `CONTEXT.md` (when present) in addition to `CLAUDE.md` before writing code; CONTEXT.md sections override generic CLAUDE.md conventions for that epic.
- `project-orchestrate` Step 16 ADR creation now explicitly shares a single sequential numbering pool with design-spike ADRs and hand-authored ADRs (next number = `max(existing) + 1`).
- `project-orchestrate` Step 2 sprint planning explicitly affirms the `blocked_by` gate so implementation stories naturally wait for their design-spike blockers to complete.
- `CONVENTIONS.md` documents the `type:design-spike` label, the `epic_type: design-spike` frontmatter field (local mode), and the design-spike epic workflow under Epic Structure.
- `README.md` documents the new Two-Pass Mode and Design-Spike Epic features, the new config keys, the PRD frontmatter overrides, and updates the Autonomous Orchestration Phase 1 flow to thread the design-spike epic.
- Single-pass behavior preserved — small PRDs (single epic, < 5000 words, no frontmatter overrides) continue through the original path unchanged. Backward compatible.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-02-16

### Changed
- Three-tier branch model: story → release → development → main (adds development as sprint approval gate)
- Expanded `project-emulate` walkthrough lifecycle with detailed sub-steps per stage
- Improved `sprint-plan` with structured proposed sprint output table
- Enhanced `sprint-release` with detailed PR body template, milestone closing, and error handling
- Added release branch health and actionable recommendations to `sprint-status`
- Simplified board views in `CONVENTIONS.md` (6 → 5 views)
- Added `rolled-over` status signal label to `CONVENTIONS.md`
- Updated README branch strategy to reflect three-tier model

### Removed
- Removed `allowed-tools` and `argument-hint` from skill frontmatter
